Solo Project Outline:
Name: Austin Nye
Project Title: Artist App
Project Description:
This will be an art-focused social media app. I am hoping to make the focus about creativity and productivity, and less about being
"social". There will be a login/registration page that will allow you to create an account (validations included). 
There will be a way to create projects which will be shown through photos of finished projects.
 With in the projects section,there will an option for liking and commenting.
 
New Programming Concept(s) I'm planning to learn:
- Having a place where users can upload images.
- Creating an application with two MTM relationships. 
- Learn Bootstrap really well. (Making this look AWESOME).

### Using this as a starting point for an application I actually want to make trying to get artists to create more, share more, and 
create communities in their areas ###
